## Trained SVM classifier using sklearn digits dataset (i.e. from sklearn.datasets import load_digits) and then,

- Measured accuracy of model using different kernels such as rbf and linear.
- Tuned model further using regularization and gamma parameters and tried to come up with highest accurancy score
- Used 80% of samples as training data size

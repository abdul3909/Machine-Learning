## 1. Credit card applications

<li>First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.</li>
<li>We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.</li>
<li>We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.</li>
<li>After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.</li>
<li>Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.</li>
</ul>

## 1. Predict Blood Donations

<li>Built a binary classifier to predict if a blood donor is likely to donate again.</li>

<li>First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.</li>
<li>We will see that the dataset contains only numerical values.</li>
<li>We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.</li>
<li>After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.</li>
<li>Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.</li>
</ul>
